# OF-CONFIG server for Open vSwitch

About this Project
------------------

Configuration and Management working group (CMWG) of the Open Networking
Foundation (ONF) prepared OpenFlow Management and Configuration Protocol
(OF-CONFIG) for switch management in an OpenFlow environment. Unfortunately,
Open vSwitch (OVS), the leading open-source implementation of an OpenFlow
switch, uses its own Open vSwitch Data Base management (OVSDB) protocol.
This holds back a wider acceptance of the OF-CONFIG protocol.

To overcome this state, it is necessary to implement support of the OF-CONFIG
protocol into OVS. This implementation should be easily available for the OVS
users to allow them utilization of the OF-CONFIG protocol.

We are going to implement an application extending the OVSâ€™s OVSDB server with
an external application implementing the OF-CONFIG protocol. We utilize OVSDB
server since it is highly integrated in the OVS architecture and bypassing the
entire OVSDB would be counterproductive.

OF-CONFIG uses NETCONF as the asociated protocol. So, the OF-CONFIG protocol
and the NETCONF protocol are interchangeable terms in this context.


Architectural Overview
----------------------

The following diagram shows how the OF-CONFIG server is intergated into the
Open vSwitch architecture. While the OF-CONFIG server is running as a system
daemon (service), the NETCONF agents are invoked as an SSH Subsystem separately
for each connected OF-CONFIG client.
